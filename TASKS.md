# SPY Strangle Bot - MVP Tasks

## 📈 **Progress Update (Latest)**

### ✅ **Major Infrastructure Milestone Completed**
**Date**: September 6, 2025
**Status**: **MVP Core Architecture Complete** - Ready for API Testing

**Completed This Session:**
- 🔗 **Storage Integration** - Connected JSON storage layer to main bot
- 🔧 **Position Management** - Fixed `checkExistingPosition()` and full state tracking  
- 🚪 **Exit Logic** - Complete `executeExit()` with P&L calculation and statistics
- 💾 **Entry Persistence** - `executeEntry()` now saves positions with state machine
- ⚙️ **Configuration** - Working `config.yaml` ready for API credentials
- ✅ **Compilation Verified** - Bot builds and starts correctly (9.5MB binary)

**Architecture Quality**: 
- ✅ Interface-based design with proper dependency injection
- ✅ State machine for position lifecycle management  
- ✅ Atomic file operations with error handling
- ✅ Graceful error handling and structured logging
- ✅ Risk management and allocation limits enforced

**Next Steps**: Add Tradier API credentials to test paper trading end-to-end

1. Enter SPY short strangles when IVR > 30
2. Exit at 50% profit (via OTOCO) or 21 DTE  
3. Apply emergency stops (250% loss, 5 DTE)
4. Run unattended for 1 week without issues
5. Complete 3 successful trade cycles
