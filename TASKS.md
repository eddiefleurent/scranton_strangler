## Removed Complexity (Post-MVP)

### Unnecessary for MVP
- ❌ Advanced order types (OCO, Bracket orders)
- ❌ Multiple position management
- ❌ SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- ❌ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- ❌ Circuit breakers and observability
- ❌ Web dashboards and monitoring
- ❌ Multi-asset support
- ❌ Backtesting framework

### Keep It Simple
- ✅ Interface abstractions (Broker/Strategy/Storage) - implemented for MVP
- ✅ Simple state machine (OPEN/CLOSED positions)
- ✅ OTOCO orders (in-scope) vs OCO/Bracket (post-MVP)
- ✅ One position at a time
- ✅ JSON file storage
- ✅ Basic tests for math functions
- ✅ Simple retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Console logging with timestamps
- ✅ SPY only
- ✅ Forward testing only

## CRITICAL TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS (Current Coverage: See CI Report)

### ✅ COMPLETED - Good Test Coverage:
1. **Core Strategy Logic** (`internal/strategy/strangle.go`) - 60% Coverage
   - `CheckEntryConditions()` - Entry signal validation
   - `FindStrangleStrikes()` - Strike selection and credit validation
   - `CheckExitConditions()` - All exit condition logic
   - `GetCurrentIVR()` - IV rank calculation
   - `CalculatePnL()` - Position value calculations

2. **Broker API Integration** (`internal/broker/tradier.go`) - 73.1% Coverage
   - `GetQuote()` - Quote fetching with error handling
   - `GetOptionChain()` - Option data parsing and validation
   - `PlaceStrangleOrder()` - OTOCO order creation
   - `GetOrderStatus()` - Order fill verification

3. **Main Bot Loop** (`cmd/bot/main.go`) - 0% Coverage
   - `runTradingCycle()` - Complete trading workflow
   - `executeEntry()` - Position opening logic
   - `executeExit()` - Position closing logic
   - `checkExistingPosition()` - Position monitoring

4. **Order Management** (`internal/orders/manager.go`) - 68% Coverage
   - `PollOrderStatus()` - Order status polling
   - Order timeout and retry handling
   - Partial fill scenarios

5. **Retry Client** (`internal/retry/client.go`) - 91.5% Coverage
   - Exponential backoff implementation
   - Error classification and retry logic
   - Timeout and circuit breaker behavior

### ✅ Well-Tested Components (>70% Coverage):
- State Machine (78.1%) - Position state transitions
- Mock Data Provider (82.8%) - Testing infrastructure
- Storage Interface (44.2%) - Position persistence

### 🎯 Test Coverage Targets for MVP Launch:
- **Overall Coverage**: 48.6% → **60%+** (minimum)
- **Strategy Functions**: 60% → **80%+** (critical path)
- **Broker Integration**: 73.1% → **70%+** (API reliability)
- **Main Bot Loop**: 0% → **60%+** (core functionality)
- **Orders & Retry**: 68%/91.5% → **70%+** (resilience)

### 📋 Testing Priority Order:
1. **✅ Week 1**: Strategy function unit tests (highest impact) - 60% coverage
2. **✅ Week 2**: Broker integration tests with mocks - 73.1% coverage
3. **Week 3**: Main bot loop integration tests - 0% coverage (REMAINING BLOCKER)
4. **✅ Week 4**: Order management and retry logic tests - 68%/91.5% coverage
5. **Week 5**: End-to-end testing in sandbox environment

**Bottom Line**: Test coverage has improved significantly but main bot loop testing remains the key blocker for MVP deployment. The core trading logic needs integration tests before production use.
